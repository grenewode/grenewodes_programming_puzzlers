# The Problem:
Create an associative mapping between types in C++. This mapping should have the following properties:
1. All operations are resolved at compile time.
2. When the mapping structure is created, it will be given a set of pairs, where each pair is an entry in the map. Each pair will consist of a single type as the key and a single type as the "value".
3. Given a key type K, it should be possible to recover its associated type V.

See [sample.cpp](https://github.com/grenewode/grenewodes_programming_puzzlers/blob/master/001/sample.cpp) to get started!
